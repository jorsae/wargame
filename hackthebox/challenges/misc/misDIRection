subfolders have numbers in them
make program to write the program of the directory in the order of the filenames

import os, re
import glob

folder_list = glob.glob('.secret/*')

order = []
for folder in folder_list:
    folder_letter = folder.replace('.secret/', '')
    for _, _, files in os.walk(folder):
        for f in files:
            if int(f) <= 9:
                f = '0'+f
            order.append(f + ':' + folder_letter)

order.sort()

order = ''.join(order)
order = re.sub('\d{2}:', '', order)
print(order)

take output and base64 decode and we get the flag
