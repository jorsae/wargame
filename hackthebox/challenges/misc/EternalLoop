Download Eternal_Loop.zip
After unzip and some testing, the password for the next zip file is the name of the zip file inside.

Write a script to automate this process
import zipfile

done = False

zf = zipfile.ZipFile('Eternal_Loop.zip')
new_zip = zf.namelist()[0]

zf.extractall(pwd=b'hackthebox')

while True:
    zf = zipfile.ZipFile(new_zip)
    new_zip = zf.namelist()[0]
    print(new_zip)
    if new_zip is None:
        break
    password = new_zip.split('.')[0]
    zf.extractall(pwd=password.encode())

After reaching the last zipfile '6969.zip' the password DoNotTouch does not work.
Bruteforce the password with fcrackzip:
    fcrackzip -u -D -p '/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt' 6969.zip -v

DoNotTouch is a sqlite file with bunch of records
Have to find the flag inside all the noise.
Write script to dump the entire database

import sqlite3
import os

filename = 'DoNotTouch'
with sqlite3.connect(filename) as conn:
    conn.row_factory = sqlite3.Row
    cursor = conn.cursor()    
    cursor.execute("SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table'")
    for tablerow in cursor.fetchall():
        table = tablerow[0]
        cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM {t}".format(t = table))
        for row in cursor:
            for field in row.keys():
                print(table, field, row[field])

cat the database dump and grep for "htb"
found the flag
