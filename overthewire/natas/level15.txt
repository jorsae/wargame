run level15.py
it will bruteforce the password 1 character at a time

Explanation:
You have sql injection, however you can't actually fetch all the text you want.
e.g. you can't just select password from users and output the password.
You can do it with a union, but can't actually get the page to return the password.
However you can use boolean checks, because the website will return
"This user exists" if it's true, and "This user doesn't exist" if the query is false

However you can do a bool check. So you can test a user, in this case "natas16" and check if the password is equal to a character%
% as a wildcard, and then you can iterate through all alpha numberic characters you want to test.


Effectively creating a bruteforce, but you only need to bruteforce 1 char at a time, so it's a lot faster.
