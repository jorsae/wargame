Wrote my own php script to test: see level23.php
If we pass "iloveyou", we fulfill the first criteria.
If we pass "20", we fulfill the second criteria.
We need to combine this together.

Looking at php docs for strstr : https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.strstr.php
We can see that strstr "Find the first occurrence of a string"

Try to have a number first like 20iloveyou and it works!
