The vulnerability is in mywrite and myread.
To be a admin a flag $_SESSION["admin"] = 1, has to be set

mywrite:
The users session is stored in a file and saved.

myread:
Tries to read the user session to store it.
If we can get admin 1, to be stored here, we will be granted admin and can read the flag.
myread will read the file one line at a time, the first being set to user.
What we can do is to add more than one line at a time.
So if we can add user <username> and then admin 1, in one go, we can refesh and become admin.

run level20.py to exploit this vulnerability.

php -f a.php -S localhost:8000
To test it locally.
