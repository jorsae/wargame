No input on the main page, so you have to be able to set "admin 1" on the natas21-experimenter.
They will share the session as their tld is the same, only the subdomain is different.

If you send a request with ?debug, you can see that [debug] => shows up as a key.
So if we try to send "&admin=1" it will work.
Something like this: ?debug&admin=1

run level21.py
